# V5 - Performane Tuning

## Fake Data Modeling

Link to python file used to construct the million rows of data: 

The total number of rows that this code generates is . 

## Performance Results of Hitting Endpoints

### Execution time of each endpoint

1. GET - Get Purchase Categorized by Transaction - 
2. GET - Get Transactions - 
3. POST - Create Transaction - 
4. PUT - Update Transaction - 
5. DELETE - Delete Transaction - 
6. POST - Create User -
7. GET - Get User -

12. GET - Get Purchases - 
13. POST - Create Purchase - 
14. PUT - Update Purchase - 
15. DELETE - Delete Purchase -
