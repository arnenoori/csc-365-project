**Project Description:** \
Our project idea is to create a budget tracking app that assists users with tracking and managing their finances. Users can manually enter purchases as well as photos of receipts in order to store and track their purchases. These receipt images will be converted into text and stored in the database. We also plan to integrate Chat GPT in order to provide users recommendations for searching for their past purchases and providing recommendations to the user. Users will also be able to update financial goals and receive recommendations for managing their budget in the future.
