Project Description:
Our project idea is to create a budget tracking app that assists users with tracking and managing their finances. Users can manually enter purchases as well as photos of receipts in order to store and track their purchases. These receipt images will be converted into text and stored in the database. We also plan to integrate Chat GPT in order to provide users recommendations for searching for their past purchases and providing recommendations to the user. Users will also be able to update financial goals and receive recommendations for managing their budget in the future. 




Project Ideas:
Product ideas tracker
Users can research and upload project ideas with information about the purpose of the project technologies necessary, etc
Could integrate GPT to recommend similar projects or give more explanation for  projects that are stored 
Could have different pages for different types of projects 
Receipt / Finance app
Upload photo of receipt -> converts photo into useable text and stores in database
Users can use app to store purchases and other financial payments in order to track their budget and store proof of purchases that they have made in the past
Could integrate GPT to ask questions about the purchases that have been made in the past and other data that is stored in the database
GPT could also be used to help form users form budgets and make better financial decisions based on their previous record of financial payments
